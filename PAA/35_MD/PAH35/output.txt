    APBS uses FETK (the Finite Element ToolKit) to solve the
    Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically.  FETK is a portable collection
    of finite element modeling class libraries developed by the Michael Holst
    research group and written in an object-oriented form of C.  FEtk is
    designed to solve general coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential
    equations using adaptive finite element methods, inexact Newton methods,
    and algebraic multilevel methods.  More information about FEtk may be found
    at <http://www.FEtk.ORG>.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    APBS also uses Aqua to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically.  
    Aqua is a modified form of the Holst group PMG library <http://www.FEtk.ORG>
    which has been modified by Patrice Koehl
    <http://koehllab.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/> for improved efficiency and
    memory usage when solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.

    APBS uses FETK (the Finite Element ToolKit) to solve the
    Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically.  FETK is a portable collection
    of finite element modeling class libraries developed by the Michael Holst
    research group and written in an object-oriented form of C.  FEtk is
    designed to solve general coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential
    equations using adaptive finite element methods, inexact Newton methods,
    and algebraic multilevel methods.  More information about FEtk may be found
    at <http://www.FEtk.ORG>.

    APBS also uses Aqua to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically.  
    Aqua is a modified form of the Holst group PMG library <http://www.FEtk.ORG>

    APBS uses FETK (the Finite Element ToolKit) to solve the
    Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically.  FETK is a portable collection
    of finite element modeling class libraries developed by the Michael Holst
    research group and written in an object-oriented form of C.  FEtk is
    designed to solve general coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential
    equations using adaptive finite element methods, inexact Newton methods,
    and algebraic multilevel methods.  More information about FEtk may be found
    at <http://www.FEtk.ORG>.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    APBS also uses Aqua to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically.  
    Aqua is a modified form of the Holst group PMG library <http://www.FEtk.ORG>
    which has been modified by Patrice Koehl
    <http://koehllab.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/> for improved efficiency and
    memory usage when solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.
